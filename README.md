Between the sheets

Between the sheets is traditionally a card game where a 2 cards are initially dealt, and then guessing on whether the 3rd card will be inside the range of rank of the first 2 cards, outside the rank of of the first 2 cards or a tie.

In this version, the player will be guessing the value between 2 randomly generated numbers between 0 and 10 and the user will be asked guess the 3rd randomly generated number will be inside or outside.  In the event of a tie in the first 2 randomly generated numbers, the user will automatically lose.  The score will be counted on how many consecutive rounds the user can get correctly.
